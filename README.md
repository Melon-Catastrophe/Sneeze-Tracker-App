# Overview

I find apps to be interesting. Everybody has tons of them on their phone. They help boost productivity, they entertain, and they can be a tool that adds incredible functionality to people's devices. It would be an amazing endeavor to add to that set of tools. So I decided to make an app that would be useful to other people.

I present to you: Sneeze Tracker, the all-in-one solution for keeping track of all of your sneeze-related inquiries, such as, *How often do I **actually** sneeze?*, *Do I ever sneeze?*, and the infamous *Is it *normal* to sneeze?* This app will answer all of these queries and more.

To use Sneeze Tracker, simply tap on the date that you would like to record a sneeze for, and then tap on the plus/minus buttons until the Daily Sneeze number shows the number of times you sneezed that day. These numbers are automatically saved to a local file. To view the statistics of your sneezes, click the menu icon in the bottom-left of the screen.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio in the Kotlin language to develop this mobile application.

# Challenges

The most challenging part of this project was working with creating a file to store the user's data in. Beyond that, app development is complicated, and it needs to be. There are so many potential functions that a developer needs access to to make a good app, and there likely is not an easy way to simplify that. This is the most difficult coding project that I have taken to date, and it is also a very simple app.

# Future Work

* If a sneeze counter for a particular date reaches zero, the app should remove that from the db.txt file.
* Add more sneeze statistics (Average sneezes per day, number of sneezes per unit of time, etc.).
* Clean up code and make it consistent.
